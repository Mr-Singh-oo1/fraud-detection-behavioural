# 🧠 Fraud Analytics Pipeline Architecture

This document outlines the design and logic behind the fraud alert exploratory analysis and reporting system. It emphasizes modularity, explainability, and reproducibility for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

---

## 📦 1. Data Ingestion

- **Source**: `alerts.csv` (synthetic or real-time alerts)
- **Format**: Tabular, with fields like `event_time`, `amount`, `is_fraud`, behavioral and velocity features
- **Handling**:
  - Timestamp parsing (`event_time`)
  - Numeric coercion (`amount`)
  - Binary conversion (`is_fraud`)

---

## 🧼 2. Data Cleaning & Enrichment

- Missing value detection and visualization
- Feature engineering:
  - `hour`, `dayofweek`, `is_weekend` from timestamps
  - Behavioral metrics: `typing_speed`, `nav_speed`, `geo_distance_km`
  - Velocity metrics: `velocity_1h`, `velocity_24h`, `unique_devices_30d`
  - Anomaly metrics: `amount_over_user_avg`

---

## 📊 3. Exploratory Analysis

- Distribution plots for fraud vs non-fraud
- Time-based transaction patterns
- Behavioral and velocity feature comparisons
- Correlation heatmap for numeric features

Each chart is saved with:
- `.png` image
- `_desc.txt` explanation
- UTF-8 encoding for emoji and formatting

---

## 🧾 4. Reporting Layer

- All outputs saved to `reports/` folder
- Summary stats and insights logged as `.txt`

## 🎯 Design Principles

- **Explainability**: Every chart has a description
- **Reproducibility**: Modular code, consistent outputs
- **Stakeholder Readiness**: One-click `.docx` report
- **Scalability**: Easy to extend with model metrics or alert scoring

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Add model scoring and risk tiering
- Automate report generation via GitHub Actions
- Publish annotated sample outputs in README
